I wanted to fork the repository "css-exercises"/TheOdinProject but since i have already forked this repo before and it ("css-exercises") exists on 
my repositories on GitHub, I could not fork it. So, I created a new directory "css-exercises" on my local machine. 
Then, cloned from GitHub "css-exercises"/TheOdinProject into my local machine "css-exercises" directory. And, created a new repository 
"css-exercises-2ndtime"  on Github. Finally, pushed from my local machine the directory "css-exercises" to the repository "css-exercise-2ndtime" on GitHub.
To sum up, I mirrored "css-exercises"/TheOdinProject since/instead of that I could not fork directly.
